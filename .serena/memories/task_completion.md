Before finishing work:

- Ensure lint (`cd nextjs && pnpm lint`) and any relevant builds/docs commands succeed.
- Update documentation inside `docs/` for new features and follow bilingual structure when relevant.
- Verify Supabase migrations (if affected) are generated via CLI and referenced in PR.
- Confirm changes align with OpenSpec (create/attach proposal when feature-level work) and follow Conventional Commits.
- Highlight missing tests if none exist; add unit/integration tests per standards when touching logic.
